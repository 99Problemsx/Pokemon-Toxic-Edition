# About this plugin
#=====================================================================
#
# This is a plugin version of the new Battle Animation Editor that
# will be added to the next version of Essentials (v22). It is
# provided as a plugin to give people the opportunity to try it out,
# find bugs and make suggestions for improvements. It can also be used
# to make new animations that will be included with Essentials.
#
# This is considered to be a BETA version of the new Battle Animation
# Editor. Further changes will be made to add functionality and in
# response to feedback. While you can use this plugin as-is, I would
# strongly recommend upgrading to the next version of Essentials (when
# it comes out) to use this Editor properly.
#
# This plugin's contents are also in the Essentials GitHub repo, in
# the "animations" branch. You can discuss this Battle Animation
# Editor in the #project-animations channel of the Game Dev Café
# server on Discord: https://discord.gg/PFpYTrgKES
#
#=====================================================================
# How to use the Editor
#=====================================================================
#
# The Battle Animation Editor is accessible from the main Debug menu.
#
# The Battle Animation Editor uses a mouse input, and cannot be used
# solely with the keyboard. It deliberately has little documentation,
# as it is designed to be intuitive to use - if something confuses
# you, bring it up as feedback and it can be improved.
#
# For particles with a focus of "User and target", the user is
# considered to be at position 0,0 and have a priority (z) of 0, and
# the target is considered to be at position 200,-200 and have a
# priority of -100.
#
# Keyboard shortcuts:
#
# The Battle Animation Editor has a number of keyboard shortcuts to
# help your workflow. These are:
#
# - Escape	Closes any pop-up window.
# - Space	Plays the animation, or stops it if it is currently
#		playing.
# - Up/Down	Change which particle is selected.
# - Left/Right	Change which keyframe is selected.
# - S		Swaps the two sides of battle in the canvas, i.e.
#		changes which side the user is on.
# - P		Toggles whether individual property lines in the
#		timeline are shown for the currently selected
#		particle.
# - Insert	Adds an empty keyframe to the selected particle at the
#		current keyframe. This shifts all later commands 1
#		frame later. Holding "Shift" when pressing this does
#		the same but for all particles.
# - Delete	Deletes the current keyframe for the selected
#		particle. This shifts all later commands 1 frame
#		earlier. Holding "Shift" when pressing this does the
#		same but for all particles.
#
# In addition:
#
# - The mouse scroll wheel will scroll various things (including a
#   horizontal scrollbar if hovering over that). Scrollbars are fully
#   interactive.
# - "Home"/"End", "Backspace"/"Delete" and "Return"/"Escape" work as
#   you'd expect while entering text into a text box. If the text box
#   is for a number, "+"/"-" can be typed anywhere in the number to
#   change its sign.
# - You can click to select a particle in the canvas, and click-drag
#   a selected particle in the canvas to move it.
#
#=====================================================================
# Files
#=====================================================================
#
# Animations have three kinds of files:
#
# - PBS files in the "PBS\Animations\" folder.
# - Graphic files in the "Graphics\Battle animations\" folder.
# - Audio files in the "Audio\SE\Anim" folder.
#
# In all cases, these files may go in subfolders within the folders
# mentioned above.
#
# If an animation particle's graphic is over 2 times wider than it is
# tall (strictly over, not "equal to or wider than"), it is assumed to
# be a spritesheet rather than a single graphic. This means it is made
# up of square images (frames) placed side by side, and an animation
# particle using that graphic will only show one frame.
#
#=====================================================================
# Example content
#=====================================================================
#
# This plugin is shipped with a lot of example animations. Their PBS
# files live in the "PBS\Animations\Example anims\" folder, and their
# spritesheets live in the "Graphics\Battle animations\Examples\"
# folder. They make use of existing audio files.
#
# These animations are ones that already exist in Essentials. They
# will all be replaced by new animations in the end.
